      <p>
        Blue Badges help people with disabilities or health conditions park closer to their destination. You can apply for a badge for yourself, on behalf of somebody else or an organisation that transports people that need a Blue Badge.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <a href="#">England, Scotland and Wales you can apply on GOV.UK</a> for a Blue Badge.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">
        There’s a different way to <a href="#">apply if you’re in Northern Ireland</a>.
